    <h5>Ah well, on with the show!</h5>
    <h4>Magical me</h4>

    <p>My name is Malachi Cleland (pronounced Mala’kai, but feel free to call me Mal), my student number is s3965226 and my student email is s395226@rmit.edu.au.

I was born in Australia, currently live and grew up in a small country… um, area (town’d be a bit of a stretch), though I’m looking to move to Melbourne in the near future, having lived there for almost two years in the past when I almost-completed an advanced diploma.
I love writing, like drawing - haven't drawn in a while actually - pencil is my medium of choice as I’m a bit of an art snob / purist in that using a tablet and style (personally), is a bit of a cop out. It’s something about seeing my imagination forged in reality that really does it for me. Most of the time I’m not on the computer or 360/PS3, I’ll be reading my heart out. Or re-reading most everything on my bookshelves. Actually in completing this assignment I’ve developed a bit of a soft spot for HTML and CSS, so I’ll be pleased if I can carve some time out to learn more about the both of them and their applications.

I learnt Indonesian in Years 7 & 8, many moons ago, and would have continued down that track had it not clashed with small motors and engineering in Year 9, though I’ve wanted to learn plenty of languages since (German probably at the top of the list). I know that plenty of people don’t like to talk themselves up - myself included -, but over time in life you figure out what some of your talents are, and I honestly believe that I take to (spoken) languages like a duck to water, and on the list of ‘jobs to have before I kark it and reincarnate’, is translator, because bridging language barriers and bringing people together is a pretty beautiful thing, in my opinion. Plus if you do what you love you never call it work, right?

Also, apologies for the whole ‘staring into your soul’ thing (gap left on purpose).

The picture is from an old concession card - I would have used the original as I still have a handful of those left, though at current I’ve got about two hours till this assignment is due (skipping back and forth between sections), so this’ll have to make do for now.
